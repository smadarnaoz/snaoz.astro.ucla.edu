      <p > Recent measurements of anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) radiation have revealed the detailed distribution of matter in
the Universe a few hundred thousand years after the Big Bang.  Observations
utilizing large ground-based telescopes and space telescopes have
discovered galaxies and black holes that were in place when the age of
the Universe was less than a billion years.  Moreover, many galaxies
have been found at z > 7 in the Hubble
Ultra Deep Field, whereas already a few gamma-ray bursts at z > 6
have been detected by the  satellite.
 These first objects are probably
the building blocks of the present day galaxies, thus, solving the
puzzle behind their formation will have a profound implication on our
understanding of the Universe</p>
<p > 


<p>High redshift gas-rich halos may very well be a nurturing ground for dwarf galaxies, which at high redshift can form stars  perhaps even at a high star formation rate , and thus, may produce a clear signature on the 21cm signal. Moreover, halos that are too small for efficient cooling via atomic hydrogen, and did not host astrophysical sources, still contribute to the 21-cm signal since they can block ionizing radiation
 and produce an overall delay in the initial progress of reionization.
Thus, investigating the formation
properties of these halos is of prime importance .
</p>

<p>
The formation of the first generation of galaxies in the universe has been studied for many years, using different computational tools. On one hand, high-resolution simulations can describe very accurately and reliably complex gas processes and gravitational interactions. On the other hand, analytical calculations can be used to provide a physical intuition, understanding some results of simulations as well as some of the effects of the limited resolution and decouple the various physical effects. Combining the two approaches offers many of advantages, which is the apporoch we took in these projects. 
</p>

<p>
The initial conditions (hereafter ICs) in a cosmological simulation
can have a large effect on the formation of the first galaxies in
simulations, i.e., both on the formation time (or on the halo
abundance at a given time) and the halo properties at formation time (such
as the average gas fraction). 
</p>

<p>
In Naoz et al. 2010 we test three
different linear power spectra for the initial conditions: (1) A
complete heating model, which is our fiducial model; this model
follows the evolution of overdensities correctly, according to
Naoz & Barkana 2005, in particular including the spatial variation of the
speed of sound of the gas due to Compton heating from the CMB.  (2) An
equal-delta model, which assumes that the initial baryon
fluctuations are equal to those of the dark matter.
(3) A model which assumes
a uniform speed of sound of the gas.  The latter two models are often
used in the literature. We calculate the baryon fractions
for a large sample of halos in our Gadet-2 simulations. We also tested these  latter two
model using AMR. 
Our fiducial model
implies that before reionization and significant stellar heating took
place, the minimum mass needed for a minihalo to keep most of its
baryons throughout its formation was ~3e4 solar masses. However, the alternative models yield a wrong (higher
by about 50\%) minimum mass, since the system retains a memory of
the initial conditions.
We also  showed that the minimum mass that suppresses the growth of baryonic fluctuations  (due to pressure) as predicted from linear theory is consistent with the minimum mass needed for a minihalo to keep most of its baryons throughout its formation.
