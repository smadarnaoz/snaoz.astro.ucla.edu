<p> The discovery of the Jupiter like planet orbiting the nearby Sun-like star 51 Pegasi in 1995 had marked an era of 
new theoretical challenges. Specifically, in recent years planet observations showed that  planetary systems are common and exhibit  variety of characteristics. Radial velocity measurements, microlensing experiments, direct imaging and photometric transit observations reveled a wide range of masses and distances from the host star. The growing flow of new observation introduced many puzzles and raised many questions, such as; is there a common  formation mechanism of the different extrasolar systems? what  are the dominate  evolution processes? is our solar system a unique configuration?
        </p>

<p > 
Future and current observations by Kepler and CoRoT are expected to produce unprecedented detailed planets detections. However, these observations are relatively unassertive to planet far away from the star. Thus, direct imaging (such as Fomalhaut b, Kalas et al. 2008 already observed by HST) and microlensing experiments are vital for completing the picture. An important clue for the formation process may lay in the spin-orbit measurements, via the  Rossiter-McLaughlin effect (see Gaudi & Winn 2007). Different formation and evolution mechanism are expected to give different distribution of this value. Thus, the spin-orbit angle presents us with a wonderful probe to disentangle the different models. 
</p>

<p>

 The search for extra-solar planets has led to the surprising discovery
of many Jupiter-like planets in very close proximity to
their host star, the so-called ``hot Jupiters'' (HJ hereafter). Even more surprisingly, many
of these HJ have orbits that are eccentric or highly inclined with respect to the
equator of the star, and some are even
in retrograde orbits (see Triaud et al. 2010).
This poses a unique challenge to all planet
formation models.   How they get so close to the star in such
  orbits remains an open question. 

</p>

<p>
In our  general treatment of secular interactions  between two orbiting bodies
 we allow for the magnitude and orientation of
both orbital angular momenta to change.  The outer
body (either a planet or a brown-dwarf or even a binary star, as long as its not to distant)
gravitationally perturbs the inner planet on time scales long compared
to the orbital period (i.e., we consider the secular evolution of the
system). We define the orientation of the inner orbit with respect to the
invariable plane of the system (perpendicular to the 
  total angular momentum): a
prograde (retrograde) orbit has i1<90 degrees (i1>90 degrees), where
i1 is the inclination of the inner orbit with respect to the
  total angular momentum vector. Note that the word 'retrograde' is also used in the literature 
  to indicate orbital motion  counter to the stellar spin. The directly observed parameter is actually
  the projected angle between the spin axis of the star and
  the orbital angular momentum of a HJ.  
  Our proposed mechanism can produce HJs that are 'retrograde'
 both with respect to the stellar spin and with respect to the
  total angular momentum.  By contrast, a distant stellar companion
  can only succeed in the former. Henceforth we will use the term 'retrograde' only to indicate an 
  orbit with i1>90 degrees as define above.
</p>

<p>
We assume a hierarchical
configuration, with the outer perturber on a much wider orbit
than the inner one. In the secular approximation the orbits may change
shape and orientation but the semi-major axes are strictly
conserved in the absence of tidal
dissipation. In particular, the
Kozai-Lidov mechanism
produces large-amplitude oscillations of the eccentricity and
inclination when the initial relative inclination between the inner
and outer orbits is sufficiently large.
</p>

<p>
We have derived the secular evolution equations to octupole order
using Hamiltonian perturbation
theory.  In contrast
to previous derivations of ``Kozai-type'' evolution, our treatment
allows for changes in the z-components of the orbital angular
momenta (i.e., the components along the total angular momentum).
The
octupole-order equations allow us to calculate the
evolution of systems with more closely coupled orbits and with
planetary-mass perturbers. The octupole-level terms can give rise to
fluctuations in the eccentricity maxima to arbitrarily high
values, in contrast to the regular
evolution in the quadrupole
potential, where the
amplitude of eccentricity oscillations is constant.  
</p>

<p>
 Our
 treatment shows that the eccentricity can occasionally
reach a much higher value than in the regular ``Kozai cycles''
calculated to quadrupole order. Thus, the pericenter distance will
occasionally shrink on a short time scale (compared to the Kozai
period), and the planet can then suddenly be tidally captured
by the star.  We propose to call this ``Kozai capture.'' 
</p>
<p>
Kozai capture provides a new way to form HJs. If the capture happens after the inner
orbit has flipped the HJ will appear in a retrograde orbit.  During the evolution of the system the inner
orbit shrinks in steps  whenever the dissipation becomes
significant, i.e., near unusually high eccentricity maxima.  The inner
orbit can then eventually become tidally circularized.  This happens
near the end of the evolution, on a very short time scale. In this final step, the inner orbit completely and
quickly decouples from the outer perturber, and the orbital angular
momenta then become constant. 
</p>

<p>
  There are two main routes to forming a
HJ through the dynamical evolution of the systems we consider here. In
the first, tidal friction slowly damps the growing eccentricity of the
inner planet, resulting in circularized, prograde HJs. In the second,
a sudden high-eccentricity spike in the orbital evolution of the inner
planet is accompanied by a flip of its orbit. The planet is then
quickly circularized into a retrograde short-period orbit. We can
estimate the relative frequencies of these two types of outcomes using
Monte Carlo simulations. We provide a representative example: consider systems where the inner
planet was formed in situ at a1=5 AU with zero obliquity
(orbit in the stellar equatorial plane) and with some small
eccentricity e1=0.01, while the outer planet has a2= 51
AU. The masses are m1=1 Msun m2=1 MJ and m3=3 MJ.  We
draw the eccentricity of the outer orbit from a uniform distribution
and the mutual inclination from a distribution uniform in $\cos i$
between 0 and 1 (i.e., isotropic among prograde orbits). For this
case we find that, among all HJs that are formed, about 7% are in
truly retrograde motion (i.e., with respect to the total angular
momentum) and about 50% are orbiting counter to the stellar spin
direction.
  The high observed incidence of planets
orbiting counter to the stellar spin direction may suggest
that planet--planet secular interactions are an important part of
their dynamical history.
