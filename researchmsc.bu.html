      <p align="justify" class="style1 style16">The word galaxy was derived from our own galaxy, the MilkyWay, using the Greek 
        word &quot;gala&quot; which means milk. The band of light visible in the night sky, which 
        is called the Milky Way, is actually the plane of the disk of the galaxy. In our 
        universe there are countless stars and galaxies. Stars are almost always assembled 
        in collections called galaxies, together with gas, dust, and dark matter. Galaxies are 
        held together by gravitational attraction, and galactic components orbit a common 
        center, most likely containing a black hole.      </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1 style16">Edwin Hubble defined an extensive description of galaxy types but we can 
        identify three main types: ellipticals, spirals, and irregulars. These types relate to 
        the shape of the galaxy. The spiral type, which interests us, has spiral arms with the 
      shape of approximate logarithmic spirals (similar to the shape of a spiral staircase). </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1 style16">Spiral structure has been an enigma to astrophysicists for many years. The most common theory today is that spiral structure can be regarded as a density wave, 
        which revolves in the galactic disk in much the same way that waves propagate in 
        the ocean. Lin &amp; Shu (1964, 1966) were the first to apply the techniques of wave 
        mechanics in order to deduce the properties of density waves. They developed a 
        formalism called the density wave theory.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1 style16">The stars in a galaxy have a differential velocity, which means that a star nearer 
        to the center has a shorter period of rotation. Like the stars, the spiral arms also 
        rotate around the center, but unlike the stars, they do so with constant angular velocity. 
        This means that stars pass in and out of spiral arms. As gas in the interstellar 
        medium passes into the density wave, it becomes denser, and this can lead to the 
        formation of new stars. The very hottest (and brightest) stars have short lifetimes, 
        so that they are born and die very close to the density wave. This is why the spiral 
        arms are traced by the brightest and youngest stars.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1 style16">Many interesting processes take place within spiral galaxies, where the spiral<br>
        arms, in particular, play an essential role. Apart from being the primary sites of star 
        formation, spiral arms are important in determining the density, chemical composition 
        (i.e., the abundance of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, etc.), and temperature of 
        the interstellar gas as well as the dynamics of stars and gas within the galaxy. It is 
        for this reason that we wish to study the spiral arm dynamics.      </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1 style16">The Milky Way contains about 300 billion stars and has a total mass of about<br>
        a trillion times the mass of the Sun, with a disk of about or 100,000 light years<br>
        in diameter and 3,000 light years in width. Furthermore there is some evidence to 
        support the existence of a bar at the center of our galaxy (a bar is a band of high density emerging from the center and running across the middle of the galaxy). 
        The spiral structure in our galaxy is divided into several observed arms, which are 
        named after the location in which we view them in the sky, for example the Orion 
        spiral arm is viewed close to the constellation Orion. Our solar system is located 
        at the Orion &quot;armlet&quot;, about two thirds of the radius of the disk from its center.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1 style16">Today, no astronomer doubts that the Milky Way is a spiral galaxy. Still, our<br>
        edge-on view and dust obscuration through the galactic disk does not permit us to 
        see the structure and pattern of the spiral arms directly. It is for this reason that it 
        is difficult to unequivocally determine properties of the spiral arms in our galaxy. 
        In my Master&rsquo;s thesis work, my advisor, <a href="http://www.phys.huji.ac.il/%7Eshaviv/">Nir Shaviv</a> and I mapped and studied the kinematics and dynamics 
        of the Milky Way&rsquo;s spiral arms in our vicinity using the birth locations of open 
        clusters; an open cluster is a small group of stars all of which are born at the same<br>
        time from a molecular cloud and are still near each other. Since these objects are located 
        in the galactic plane and are born primarily in the arms, they are an excellent 
        tool for analyzing the dynamics of the spiral structure. Using their birth locations 
        and their distribution of ages, we found evidence for multiple pattern speeds. For 
        the Carina spiral arm, we found that the data is best fitted with two pattern speeds, 
&quot;faster&quot; and &quot;slower&quot;. In other words, the Carina arm actually consists of two different 
arms, which happen to co-exist in the same region. Furthermore we found 
that the &quot;slower&quot; Carina arm and the Perseus spiral arm are most probably moving 
in the same speed, which means that they are part of the same wave pattern. The 
solar system passes one arm of this set about every one hundred and forty million 
years. The speed of the Orion arm and the speed of the &ldquo;faster&rdquo; Carina arm are 
close to that of the solar system&rsquo;s speed around the galactic center. Since our solar 
system is located in the Orion arm, it will leave this arm in about two hundred 
million years.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1 style16"><br>
        <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0209252">Shaviv (2002)</a> suggested a possible connection between the passing of the solar<br>
        system in a spiral arm and Earth&rsquo;s climate, especially a connection to the formation 
        of clouds due to the arrival of particles generated near dying stars to the Earth&rsquo;s 
        upper atmosphere. Therefore our work may contribute to the understanding of 
        Earth&rsquo;s climate history, in addition to help us gain a better understanding of our 
      own galaxy. </a><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0503127">Want to know more?</a> </p></td>
