<p align="justify" class="style2 style3">
The cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation is an electromagnetic
radiation at frequencies in the microwave range, which arrives at
Earth with equal intensity in all directions. This is evidence for an
important event in the history of the universe, about 400,000 years
after the Big Bang, namely the cosmic recombination. At recombination
the electrons and protons formed hydrogen atoms, thus making the
universe transparent to radiation. </p>
      
<p align="justify" class="style2">
Observations of the CMB show that the universe at cosmic recombination
was remarkably uniform, apart from spatial fluctuations in the gas
density and in the gravitational force of roughly one part in
100,000. The primordial inhomogeneities in the density distribution
continued to grow and led to the formation of galaxies at more recent
times. Therefore these small-amplitude perturbations at recombination
can be regarded as the initial conditions for the formation of
galaxies. About 30 million years after recombination the first
sources of light appeared, their radiation began to heat the cosmic
gas, and finally even reionized it (i.e., split it back to the
constituent protons and electrons).  The repercussions of the
appearance of these first galaxies is still an enigma, and is thus
interesting to study. </p>
      
<p align="justify" class="style2">
Different physical processes contribute to the growth of small
perturbations in the gas density and temperature. One of the
interesting properties of the gas is its temperature fluctuations.
Prior analyses assumed a spatially uniform speed of sound for the
gas. This assumption means that the gas density fluctuations are
proportional to its temperature fluctuations at any given time.  We
have calculated the fluctuation growth and shown that the revised
calculation has substantial consequences for the evolution of the
cosmic gas. </p>
      
<p align="justify" class="style2">
This corrected calculation can now be used for other physical
processes that happened at later times in the universe, especially in
the era after the first galaxies appeared and began to heat up the
gas. The pressure of the hot gas opposed the gravitational forces and
prevented some of the galaxies from forming. </p>

<p align="justify" class="style2">
The formation of the first galaxies in the universe has been studied
for many years. The simplest calculation considers a spherical region
initially with a small uniform density enhancement compared to the
background universe. As the universe expands the overdensity expands
slower than the background, due to the gravitational pull, until it
reaches a maximum radius, and turns around and collapses. We have
performed a more precise calculation, including all the physical
ingredients that are known today. This has various applications, such
as for the abundance of galaxies as a function of mass at various
times, and most importantly for the formation of the first galaxy in
the Universe. </p>
      
<p align="justify" class="style2">
Extensive work has been done on the formation of the first galaxy,
especially using an advance computer calculations which try to
simulate the formation of the first galaxy or star. However, even the
most advance simulation has too low a resolution, at least eleven
orders of magnitude from the required resolution, due to computational
limitations. Using the calculation mentioned before, one can estimate
the time of the formation of the first galaxies. This includes
statistical considerations which are now included correctly in our
revised analysis. </p>


<p align="justify" class="style2">
We have found that the first observable star is most likely to have
formed 30 million years after the Big Bang, much earlier than2
previously expected. Also the first galaxy as massive as our own Milky
Way likely formed when the universe was only 400 Myr old. </p>

<p align="justify" class="style2"> 
In those early objects the pressure of the gas may suppresses the
gravitational collapse. We have preformed a calculation in order to
evaluate a characteristic scale that describes the highest mass of
which the pressure suppresses growth.  In other-words the pressure
cannot be neglected for masses lower than this scale. We have found
that this scale is lower than previous estimation, and therefore the
effect of pressure in the formation of the first galaxies is only a
moderate.  </p>
      
<p align="justify" class="style2">
New observations over the next few years of the emission of more
distant objects, which is analogous to earlier times in the universe,
will help unfold the chapter in cosmic history around the era of the
first galaxies. These observations will use the neutral hydrogen
properties as a detector of the hydrogen abundance.  Neutral hydrogen
is known to emit and absorb radiation in the radio range, more
specifically at a wavelength of 21cm, equivalent to a frequency of
1420MHz.  This radiation comes from the transition between the two
levels of energy of the hydrogen lowest energy state (ground state).
Before the first sources of radiation began to reionize the gas, the
occurrence of neutral gas offers a prospect of tracing the cosmic gas,
and probing the first radiation sources. </p>
      
<p align="justify" class="style2">
Understanding the physics in detail will help to predict the
properties of 21cm observations, and to construct a cosmological
model that fits the observed features of the universe. The upcoming
21cm observations will provide a great opportunity for testing our
predictions. </p>
