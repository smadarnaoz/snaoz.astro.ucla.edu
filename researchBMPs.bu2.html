      <p align="justify" class="style1 style16">Minor planets (both asteroids and trans-Neptunian objects) are thought to be remnants of the protoplanetary disk from which the Solar system formed. In recent years many minor planets have been found to be a part of a binary system (from small satellites orbiting a primary up to comparable mass counterparts). The discovery of binary minor planets (BMPs) has raised basic questions regarding the formation and evolution of these systems and the Solar system environment. Their study is essential for understanding the formation and evolution of the Solar system. We showed that secular perturbations (long-term, small perturbations, which are observed to repeat periodically) by the Sun (i.e., Kozai mechanism) that were not taken into account in previous studies fundamentally change the evolution and the initial distribution of BMPs characteristics. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style1 style16"> 
Considering the orbit of the system around the sun, there are two parameters that are needed to be defined. The first is the system inclination, which is the angle between the binary orbit and the solar system plane. The second is the orbit eccentricity which basically measures how much the shape of the orbit deviates from a circle. These secular perturbations induce large periodic oscillations in the eccentricity and inclination of BMP orbits. An aftermath of the eccentricity oscillations is that the binary members change the minimal (and maximal) distance of their elliptical orbit. If the minimal distance is close enough the BMP members will exhibit tidal interactions. The combined effects of these processes could also lead to migration of the BMPs into close configurations and even coalescence and the formation of irregularly shaped single minor planets with unique characteristics. We showed that the Kozai effect has a major role in the evolution of BMPs, and could inherently change the observational signatures of the BMPs formation and evolution scenarios from those suggested by previous studies. Despite the relative small statistical sample, it seems that our predicted observational signature is consistent with current observations. We showed that the Kozai effect can be observed within the next few years, even with current accuracy. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style1 style16">We also conduct, for the first time, statistical analysis of orbital properties such as eccentricity and relative inclination, for a sample of BMPs with full orbital solutions. We find that BMPs are high inclined relative to their revolution around the Sun. In addition, we see that the eccentricity distribution deviates from thermal (i.e., Maxwellian). These findings have a profound effect on different formation scenarios suggested in the literature.</p>
