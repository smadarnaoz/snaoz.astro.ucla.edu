      <p align="justify" class="style2 style3">The cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation is an electromagnetic radiation at frequencies in the microwave range, which arrives at Earth with equal intensity in all directions. This is evidence for an important event in the history of the universe, about 400,000 years after the Big Bang, namely the cosmic recombination. At recombination the electrons and protons formed hydrogen atoms, thus making the universe transparent to radiation. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style2">Observations of the CMB show that the universe at cosmic recombination was remarkably uniform, apart from spatial fluctuations in the gas density and in the gravitational force of roughly one part in 10^5. The primordial inhomogeneities in the density distribution continued to grow and led to the formation of galaxies at more recent times. Therefore these small-amplitude perturbations at recombination can be regarded as the initial conditions for the formation of galaxies. About 100 million years after recombination the first sources of light appeared, their radiation began to heat the cosmic gas, and finally even reionized it (i.e., split it back to the constituent protons and electrons). The repercussions of the appearance of these first galaxies is still an enigma, and is thus interesting to study. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style2">New observations over the next few years of the emission of more distant objects, which is analogous to earlier times in the universe, will help unfold the chapter in cosmic history around the era of the first galaxies. These observations will use the neutral hydrogen properties as a detector of the hydrogen abundance. Neutral hydrogen is known to emit and absorb radiation in the radio range, more specifically at a wavelength of 21 cm, equivalent to a frequency of 1420 MHz. This radiation comes from the transition between the two levels of energy of the hydrogen lowest energy state (ground state). Before the first sources of radiation began to reionize the gas, the occurrence of neutral gas offers a prospect of tracing the cosmic gas, and probing the first radiation sources. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style2">Understanding the physics may help to predict the properties of 21 cm observations, and construct a cosmological model which fits the observed features of the universe. Different physical processes contribute to the growth of small perturbations in the gas density and temperature. One of the interesting properties of the gas is its temperature fluctuations. Prior analyses assumed a spatially uniform speed of sound for the gas. This assumption means that the gas density fluctuations are proportional to its temperature fluctuations at any given time. We have calculated the fluctuation growth and shown that the revised calculation has substantial consequence on the evolution of the cosmic gas. </p>
    <p align="justify" class="style2">This corrected calculation can now be used for other physical processes that happened at later times in the universe, especially in the era after the first galaxies appeared and began to heat up the gas. The pressure of the hot gas opposed the gravitational forces and prevented some of the galaxies from forming.
