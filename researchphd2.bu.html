<p align="justify" class="style2 style3">
New observations over the next few years of the emission of more
distant objects, which is analogous to earlier times in the universe,
will help unfold the chapter in cosmic history around the era of the
first galaxies. These observations will use the neutral hydrogen
properties as a detector of the hydrogen abundance.  Neutral hydrogen
is known to emit and absorb radiation in the radio range, more
specifically at a wavelength of 21cm, equivalent to a frequency of
1420MHz.  This radiation comes from the transition between the two
levels of energy of the hydrogen lowest energy state (ground state).
Before the first sources of radiation began to reionize the gas, the
occurrence of neutral gas offers a prospect of tracing the cosmic gas,
and probing the first radiation sources. </p>
      
<p align="justify" class="style2">
The UV radiation from stars at that era coupled the properties of the 21cm signal with the distribution of the first galaxies. This coupling is due to a scattering of UV light on the neutral hydrogen, resulting in an effect where the object seems larger (Loeb & Rybicki 1999, like looking on a flashlight through a fog). I conducted an accurate analysis of this coupling including the ionized gas bubble around each galaxy.  </p>

<p align="justify" class="style2">
We assume a uniform neutral IGM that exhibits pure Hub- ble expansion around a steady point source. The surrounding IGM, mainly natural hydrogen, is optically thick to the UV radiation that the source emits.
We use a Monte- Carlo method for the scattering (Loeb & Rybicki 1999), for photons of various initial frequencies between Ly-alpha and the Lyman limit. 
The 21cm signal is coupled to the Ly-alpha via the Wouthuysen and Filed effect (Wouthuysen 1952; Field 1958) whereby atoms re-emitting Ly-alpha photons can de-excite into either of the hyperfine states.
</p>

<p align="justify" class="style2">
we explicitly include the ionized hydrogen (HII) region around each source, which results in enhanced Ly-alpha scattering just outside the  II region; the enhancement of the flux has a shallower rise to a peak value and then drops to zero right near the HII region, because of the loss of photons that are sctered back into the HII region.

<p align="justify" class="style2">
This result in a clear signature on the 21cm signal which can be used to detect and study the population of galaxies that formed just 200Myr after the big bang. This signature will allow the upcoming observations to study and identify the first generations of galaxies.
